Usage
=====

The library exposes a single function ``convert`` which enables conversion from different input formats
(``oldhepdata``, ``yaml``) to different output formats (``csv``, ``root``, ``yaml``, ``yoda``, ``yoda1``, ``yoda.h5``), by using a simple in-memory
intermediary format.


Python
------

.. code:: python

    import hepdata_converter

    hepdata_converter.convert('sample.oldhepdata', 'Sample', options={'input_format': 'oldhepdata', 'output_format': 'yaml'})


CLI
---

.. code:: bash

    hepdata-converter -i oldhepdata -o yaml sample.oldhepdata Sample

The default input and output formats are ``yaml`` if not specified explicitly.

See a help message with more detailed options using ``hepdata-converter -h``.
